		<h2>Who is Blue Frog and What are They All About?</h2>
		<p>Put simply, Blue Frog is a design and construction managment firm.  The difference between us and the other companies, is that we work on several 
		different levels.</p>
		<p>For the consumer, we build patio covers, pergolas, fireplaces, and outdoor kitchens along with offering swimming pool design, 
		consultation, and project management.</p>
		<p>For the pool builder, we offer project design along with consultation with regards to market evaluation, hydraulics, lead development, the sales
		process, the construction process and water chemistry.</p>

				<h4>David Simmons</h4>
				<p>Over the last 10 years, I've held nearly every job in the swimming pool industry. Knowing that good design is the foundation of any 
				great project, I've learned that most builders don't care...wanting only to get the sale and move on to the next one, and that most 
				homeowners see value in the services of a professional designer, but feel they can't afford it. The reality is that for only a few hundred 
				dollars you can insure that your project will compliment your home and add value, rather than end up being an eyesore that you can't get 
				rid of.</p>
				<p>I founded Blue Frog with the hopes of helping both builders and consumers. As a freelance designer with a background in 
				architecture, my main focus is producing great designs that keep with sound design principles. I work with builders on a daily basis all 
				over the United States to insure not only that their projects stand out from the rest, but consult with them on various ways and better 
				engineering practices to build a better swimming pool. I also hold several seminars on a annual basis to help business owners understand 
				the importance of great design, and to help them market and grow their companies.</p>
				<p>In addition to consulting with swimming pool builders, I work with homeowners in the Houston, TX market with design, bid analysis, and 
				firm selection, as well as build patio covers, fireplaces, and outdoor kitchens. As time allows, I also take on a limited number of pool 
				remodels annually. I am a family man, married for 13 years to my lovely wife and we have five beautiful children.  I wouldn't trade the times
				my family enjoys in our backyard for anything in the world, and hopefully, you will allow me to assist you with developing your outdoor space.
				Thanks for stopping by, and if there are any lingering questions you might have, feel free to contact me.</p>

			  <h4>Ryan Simmons</h4>
				<p>With over 15 years of experience in carpentry and general construction, Ryan keeps your projects on track and on budget.  Most companies 
				will boast about their level of supervision when the reality is it's just the opposite (some think supervision means you come around when it's 
				time to collect your draw payment).  Ryan is strictly hands on.  When you need him, you will rarely need to reach for your phone, but rather 
				just open your back door.  He not only makes sure that the subs comply with our rigid specifications, but he's been known to pick up a hammer 
				from time to time himself.  </p>
				<p>In addition to being very busy keeping Blue Frog jobs on track, he finds time to relax by playing music.  Ryan is the bass player for Idiginis;
				a reggae band based out of Houston.  Over the years, Ryan has had the priviledge to play with world renowned talent such as The Wailers, The 
				Commadors (post Lionel Richie), Burning Spear, Steel Pulse, Eek-a-mouse, Michael Rose, Don Carlos, and Freddie MacGregor.  Besides regular sets at 
				various clubs in the Houston area, they've toured all over the United States and Mexico.  Idiginis is currently about to release their second album.</p>
				<p>He is a devoted son, brother, and uncle to my children.</p>
