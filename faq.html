		<b class="trigger">Are you a builder or a designer?</b>
		<div class="toggle_container">
			<p>Both.  Blue Frogs goal is to provide you with the type of outdoor living space that will enhance the beauty and value of your home.  
			We do this by designing outdoor living spaces for both builders and homeowners as well as build patio covers, kitchens, and fireplaces.</p>
		</div>
		<b class="trigger">Do you build pools?</b>
		<div class="toggle_container">
			<p>No, but we work with the most reputable builders in the business.  If you're considering a pool, the first step you need to take is to get a 
			quality design in place.  Most pool builders have "salesmen" who do this for "free".  The problem is that they have little or no training in design
			and you're likely to end up with something that may be functional, but not very pretty.  These are the types of pools that decrease the value of your 
			home.  Blue Frog is capable of producing a quality design that will keep with sound design principles.  Once you have a design, you'll be able to get true
			apples to apples comparisons on bids.</p>
		</div>
		<b class="trigger">Why are pools and the bidding process so confusing?</b>
		<div class="toggle_container">
			<p>I think the major reason is that here in Texas, this industry is unregulated for the most part.  You don't have to have a license to start a pool
			company and most builders are only concerned with making the most money that they can make on a project and moving on to the next one.  They come out,
			tell a great story, and sell you the same cookie-cutter pool that your neighbor has with the same tired pile of rocks waterfall.</p>
			<p>Blue Frog is concerned about the design first.  A great design will strengthen the value of your home.  It also puts bidders on the same level playing
			field.  Rather than push the products that make builders the most money, we'll show you the many great products that are available, then you can decide 
			what's best for your family.  Wouldn't you rather have all potential contractors bidding on the same thing?
		</div>
		<b class="trigger">Can we build just the outdoor kitchen now?</b>
		<div class="toggle_container">
			<p>Of course!  We can even help you come up with a master plan.  Certain details need to be addressed if you plan to do your backyard project in stages.
			We'll take the time to make sure all of those details get addressed.</p>
		</div>
		<b class="trigger">How much do things cost?</b>
		<div class="toggle_container">
			<p>That's a tough question to answer since these are truly customized products.  It's not like going to different car dealerships and looking at the same
			car with the same features.  Most kitchens and patio covers can be built for $12,000 to $20,000.  Your average swimming pool with spas and water features
			will run $50,000 plus.  Whatever your budget is, we'll help you maximize it.  If you don't have a budget established, we'll visit with you about what you
			want to accomplish and help you establish one.</p>
		</div>
		<b class="trigger">Why is Ryan's beard so long?</b>
		<div class="toggle_container">
			<p>Some say it's because of all the Mexican food he eats...others say it's because one day he hopes to get a gig as a mall Santa.  I'm not really sure if 
			either of those is correct, but one thing I do know is he sure is proud of it!  He also plays Jesus from time to time in Vacation Bible School.</p>
		</div>
		<b class="trigger">What type of time frame does it take to complete projects?</b>
		<div class="toggle_container">
			<p>For most kitchen and patio cover projects, you can expect it to take between three to four weeks to build.  There will be lag time in getting the process
			approved by your home owners association in addition to actual build time.  For pools, every builder is different and more complicated projects can
			take six to eight weeks.</p>
		</div>
		<b class="trigger">When is the best time to take on a project like this?</b>
		<div class="toggle_container">
			<p>This is a seasonal business and the busiest time of year is from March to September.  Blue Frog is committed to a level of service that is higher
			than our competitors.  Unfortunately, that sometimes puts us in a position where we have to go on a wait list.  We will not compromise our build process
			by taking on more than we can handle and most of our clients appreciate that.</p>
		</div>
		<b class="trigger">Why should we call Blue Frog?</b>
		<div class="toggle_container">
			<p>Simple.  If you're in the market for an outdoor kitchen, patio, or fireplace, our construction process and standards are unmatched.  We'll show you
			what industry standard is, then we'll show you why our way is better.</p>
			<p>If your in the market for a pool, then our years of experience can save you thousands of dollars.  We'll help you create the right design for your home,
			we'll, help you obtain bids and analyze them, and we'll help you oversee the construction of the project to completion.  Everyone has a horror story about
			a pool builder, so don't swim with the sharks!
		</div>
		<b class="trigger">What's the first step?</b>
		<div class="toggle_container">
			<p>If you're ready to get your outdoor project going, then the first step is to give us a call and set up a time to meet with David.  As mentioned
			before, David has a wife and five kids and he enjoys spending time with his family as much as you do with yours, so he'll be happy to meet with you
			between the hours of 9:00 and 6:00, Monday through Friday and 9:00 and 12:00 on Saturday.</p>
